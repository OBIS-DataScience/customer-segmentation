# Customer Segmentation using Machine Learning

This project demonstrates how to perform customer segmentation using Machine Learning algorithms. Customer segmentation is a vital step for businesses to understand their customer base better, target marketing efforts, and provide personalized experiences to different customer segments. In this project, we will explore and compare three popular clustering algorithms: K-Means, Agglomerative Clustering, Affinity Propagation, and DBSCAN.

## Introduction
Customer segmentation is the process of dividing a customer base into groups of individuals who share similar characteristics. This can help businesses tailor their marketing strategies, product offerings, and customer service to meet the unique needs of each segment.

In this project, we will use four different clustering algorithms to segment customers based on their annual income and spending score. These algorithms will help us identify distinct customer groups, allowing businesses to target their marketing efforts effectively.

## Dataset
The dataset used in this project contains the following columns:

- `CustomerID`: A unique identifier for each customer.
- `Gender`: The gender of the customer (Male or Female).
- `Age`: The age of the customer.
- `Annual Income (k$)`: The annual income of the customer in thousands of dollars.
- `Spending Score (1-100)`: A score assigned to the customer's spending behavior, ranging from 1 to 100.

Here is a snippet of the dataset:
```
| CustomerID | Gender | Age | Annual Income (k$) | Spending Score (1-100) |
|------------|--------|-----|--------------------|-------------------------|
| 1          | Male   | 19  | 15                 | 39                      |
| 2          | Male   | 21  | 15                 | 81                      |
| 3          | Female | 20  | 16                 | 6                       |
| 4          | Female | 23  | 16                 | 77                      |
| 5          | Female | 31  | 17                 | 40                      |
```

## Installation

1. Clone the repository:
   ```
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/customer-segmentation.git
   ```

2. Install the required libraries using pip:
   ```
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

3. Run the Jupyter Notebook or Python scripts provided in the repository.

## Usage
Follow these steps to use the project:

1. Open the Jupyter Notebook or Python script that corresponds to the clustering algorithm you want to use (e.g., `KMeans_Clustering.ipynb`).

2. Execute the code cells to load the dataset, preprocess the data, and perform customer segmentation.

3. Explore the results and visualizations to gain insights into customer segments.

## Results
